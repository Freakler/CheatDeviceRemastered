Thank you for your interest in Translating CheatDevice Remastered!
This Translation add-on was originally made by danssmnt (https://github.com/danssmnt).

If you wanna start translating CDR, it's really simple:

    - Make a copy of sample.ini and rename to:

        "{Language Code of the Country}_{Country Code}.ini" (example: pt_PT.ini for Portugues (Portugal))

        Language Code of countries (use Set 1) -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes
        Country Code of countries (Alpha-2 code) -> http://www.davros.org/misc/iso3166.html

    - Change the variables in section [INFO]
    - Start translating!


READ THIS BEFORE TRANSLATING!!! VVV

When translating, you need to take in mind the following:

    - The file size can't be longer than 65535 bytes (~65.5 KB)
    - You can only use ASCII letters -> https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html
    If you try to use accented characters, they will be cut when displayed.

    - If you dont want to translate a string, just leave it blank (it will default to english in CDR)

    - If you don't wanna delete an ini file but don't want it to show on CDR, simply add "_ignore.ini" to its filename.

    The game can lag, crash or be buggy with the translations and were working on improving it!
