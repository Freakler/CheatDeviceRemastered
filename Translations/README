Thank you for your interest in Translating CheatDevice Remastered!
This Translation add-on was originally made by danssmnt (https://github.com/danssmnt).

If you wanna start translating CDR, it's really simple:

    - Make a copy of en_US.ini and rename to:

        "{Language Code of the Country}_{Country Code}.ini" (example: pt_PT.ini for Portugues (Portugal))

        Language Code of countries (use Set 1) -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes
        Country Code of countries (Alpha-2 code) -> http://www.davros.org/misc/iso3166.html

    - Change the variables in section [INFO]
    - Start translating!


When translating, you need to take in mind the following:

    - The file size can't be longer than 65535 bytes (~65.5 KB)
    - You can only use ASCII letters -> https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html
    Which means no accented characters or other alphabets (cyrillic, arabic, Devanagari) :(

    The game can lag, crash or be buggy with the translations and were working on improving it!
    If you have other questions or problems, contact us in CheatDevice Remastered's official Discord Server -> https://discord.gg/7DERFmkgYq

That's it, good luck! ;)
