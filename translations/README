Thank you for your interest in translating CheatDevice Remastered!
This Translation add-on was originally made by danssmnt (https://github.com/danssmnt).

If you wanna start translating CDR, it's really simple:

    - Make a copy of sample.ini and rename to:

        "{Language Code of the Country}_{Country Code}.ini" (example: pt_PT.ini for Portugues (Portugal))

        Countries' Language Code (use Set 1) -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes
        Countries' Country Code -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements

    - Change the info variables in section [INFO] (at the start of the .ini file)
    - Start translating!


VVVVVVV READ BEFORE TRANSLATING!!! VVVVVVV

When translating, you need to take in mind the following:

    - The language file size can't be longer than 65535 bytes (~65.5 KB)
    - You can only use ASCII Printable letters -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_character_table
    If you try to use accented or other types of characters, they will be cut when displayed.

    - If you dont want to translate a string, just leave it blank (it will default to english in CDR).

    - If you don't wanna delete an ini file but don't want it to show on CDR, simply add "_ignore.ini" to its filename.

    If you have other questions or problems related to translation, contact us in CheatDevice Remastered's official Discord Server -> https://discord.gg/7DERFmkgYq
