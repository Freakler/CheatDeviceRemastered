Thank you for your interest in translating CheatDevice Remastered!
This Translation add-on was originally made by danssmnt (https://github.com/danssmnt).

If you wanna start translating CDR, it's really simple:

    - Make a copy of sample.ini and rename to:

        "{Language Code of the Country}_{Country Code}.ini" (example: pt_PT.ini for Portugues (Portugal))

        Countries' Language Code (use Set 1) -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes
        Countries' Country Code (Alpha-2 code) -> http://www.davros.org/misc/iso3166.html

    - Change the info variables in section [INFO] (at the start of the .ini file)
    - Start translating!


VVV READ BEFORE TRANSLATING!!! VVV

When translating, you need to take in mind the following:

    - The file size can't be longer than 65535 bytes (~65.5 KB)
    - You can only use ASCII letters -> https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html
    If you try to use accented characters, they will be cut when displayed.

    - If you dont want to translate a string, just leave it blank (it will default to english in CDR)

    - If you don't wanna delete an ini file but don't want it to show on CDR, simply add "_ignore.ini" to its filename.

    If you have other questions or problems related to translation, contact us in CheatDevice Remastered's official Discord Server -> https://discord.gg/7DERFmkgYq

That's it, have fun! ;)
